# AST-KG-RAG Code Generation Project

## Project Overview

This research project aims to leverage Language Servers and Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) to create a Knowledge Graph, which will then be used as the basis for a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system to power LLM-based code generation. The project combines cutting-edge techniques in natural language processing, code analysis, and machine learning to create a novel approach to AI-assisted programming.

## Project Goals

1. Develop a system to parse and analyze code using Language Servers and ASTs
2. Create a Knowledge Graph representation of code structures and relationships
3. Implement a RAG system that utilizes the Knowledge Graph for context-aware retrieval
4. Integrate the RAG system with an LLM to generate high-quality, context-aware code
5. Evaluate the system's performance and demonstrate improvements over existing code generation techniques
