# Research Documentation

This folder contains documentation related to our ongoing research for the AST-KG-RAG Code Generation Project. Our research is organized into separate markdown files for each major topic or direction we're exploring.

## Structure

- Each research topic has its own markdown file in this folder.
- Files are named descriptively, e.g., `sourcegraph-analysis.md`, `ast-to-kg-conversion.md`, etc.
- Each file uses YAML front matter to specify its filepath for easy reference.

## Current Research Topics

- [Sourcegraph Open Source Analysis](sourcegraph-analysis.md)
- [AST to Knowledge Graph Conversion Techniques](ast-to-kg-conversion.md)
- [RAG System Optimization for Code Generation](rag-optimization.md)
- [Integration of Language Server Protocols](lsp-integration.md)
- [Performance Evaluation Metrics](performance-metrics.md)

## Adding New Research

To add a new research topic:

1. Create a new markdown file in this folder with a descriptive name.
2. Include YAML front matter with the filepath.
3. Add your research notes, findings, and ideas to the file.
4. Update this README.md to include a link to your new file.

## Updating Research

As you make progress on a research topic:

1. Update the relevant markdown file with new findings, ideas, or conclusions.
2. If the direction of research changes significantly, consider creating a new file and linking it to the original.

Remember, these documents are living resources. Regular updates will help keep all team members informed about the current state and direction of our research.
