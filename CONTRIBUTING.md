# Contributing to AST-KG-RAG Code Generation Project

Thank you for your interest in our AST-KG-RAG Code Generation Project. This is a private research project focusing on leveraging Language Servers and Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) to create a Knowledge Graph for powering LLM-based code generation.

While this is primarily a private endeavor, we welcome contributions from invited collaborators. If you've been invited to participate, please ensure your contributions align with the project's goals. Before making significant changes, discuss your ideas with the project maintainers. Follow the existing code style, provide clear documentation for your work, and include appropriate tests where necessary.

For any questions, suggestions, or to report issues, please contact the project maintainers directly. We appreciate your collaboration and look forward to your valuable input in advancing this research.
